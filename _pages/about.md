Biography
------
I'm a third-year postgraduate student at the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I also received my B.E. degree. My research focuses on secure, robust, reliable, interpretable, and trustworthy machine learning. See my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhOlC-7jzFW24zUUARxMNrgVwxxBXxy2/view?usp=sharing). I'm applying for Ph.D. positions (Fall 2023).
